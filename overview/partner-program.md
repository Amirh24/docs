# 🧑🤝🧑 Partner Program

The ShareMint partner program makes it easy to partner with top projects in web3. Our partner network has a social media reach of one million followers. It's a great way to spread awareness about your brand. Partners are incentivised to share your project as they earn a revenue share.

ShareMint partners are a curated list of web3 projects, communities and content creators. When an affiliate or referral campaign is launched on ShareMint, the owners are able to see the list of partners and invite those they would like to partner with to join as affiliates. When a partner is chosen, they will receive an email informing them about the partnership details. The partner can approve the invitation or reject it (either by clicking reject or ignoring it). When the invitation is approved, the partner becomes an affiliate. They get a unique referral url they can share it with their community or followers. The partner will earn the affiliate rewards set by the campaign owners for every purchase or mint that comes from their community. The revenue generated from these purchases can go to:

* The partner
* A community fund, controlled by the community.
* Charity

Example scenario:

* A is a web3 gaming project with a big community of gamers, they are listed as partners.
* B is a new web3 game, launching a web3 referral program on ShareMint in order to give their mint a marketing boost. Their mint price is 0.2 ETH and they set up the affiliate rewards to 10%.
* B looks at the list of partners and believes A is a good fit for partnership as A’s gaming community theme matches with the users B is looking acquire. B sends A an invitation to partner.
* A receives an email about the offer. They decide B is of high quality and that they would like to partner. A approves the invitation.
* A get their referral url for B’s upcoming mint.
* A shares their referral url with their community. Those that learn about B’s mint from A become referees, referred by A.
* 50 mints come from A’s community, generating 50 \* 0.2 ETH = 10 ETH for B.
* After the mint ends, B pays all affiliates. generating 10 ETH \* 10% = 1 ETH for A.

Soon, in addition to revenue sharing, more partnership types will be available for partners.
