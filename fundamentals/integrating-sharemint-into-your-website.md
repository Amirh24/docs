# 📝 Integrating ShareMint into your Website

ShareMint offers the ability to integrate referral tracking directly into your website.

We have a dedicated NPM package that makes it easy to integrate. You can also use our API directly to perform the same functionality.

The API and NPM package offer the following features:

* Save a user and who has referred them
* Store page visits for analytics purposes
* Fetch a referral code for a user (or create one if they don't yet have one)
