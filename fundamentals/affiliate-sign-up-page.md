# âš¡ Affiliate Sign Up Page

Upon creating a project an affiliate sign up page will be created for you where affiliates can sign up.

An affiliate can connect their wallet on this page to get their invite code.

This page also provides stats and analytics about which users they have referred, how much revenue they've generated and the ability to change their referral code.

You also have the ability to create invite codes programmatically using our [API or NPM package](integrating-sharemint-into-your-website.md).
