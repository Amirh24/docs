# ðŸ§º For NFT Marketplaces

If you run an NFT marketplace you can use ShareMint to share marketplace revenue with affiliates.

Each purchase by a user generates revenue for the platform. You can dedicate a percentage of this revenue to affiliates that refer users.

Every exchange offers affiliate rewards and an NFT marketplace should be no different.
